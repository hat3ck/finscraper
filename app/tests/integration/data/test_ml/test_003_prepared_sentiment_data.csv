The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Join us and start building with us. 

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Join us and start building with us. 

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Join us and start building with us. 

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Join us and start building with us. 

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Join us and start building with us. 

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Thanks for reading, sorry if this post sounded a little jumbled, I just wrote what was on my mind lmao, helmets on.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

u/StaySeaArt, who’s still a mod at r/SHIBArmy, played a big role in SHIB’s early growth with her street art, daily graphics, and the original SHIB media kit, all fueled by her passion for the community.

She’s now bringing that same creative energy to KenduSTREET, hosting real-world events like the last event: Florida Groves Fest with live muralists, free Kendu merch and drinks, and an evolving Community Tag Wall. It’s awesome to see real culture growing around crypto. She has done numerous mural arts for Kendu and just finished the media kit for $KENDU as well.

Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

u/StaySeaArt, who’s still a mod at r/SHIBArmy, played a big role in SHIB’s early growth with her street art, daily graphics, and the original SHIB media kit, all fueled by her passion for the community.

She’s now bringing that same creative energy to KenduSTREET, hosting real-world events like the last event: Florida Groves Fest with live muralists, free Kendu merch and drinks, and an evolving Community Tag Wall. It’s awesome to see real culture growing around crypto. She has done numerous mural arts for Kendu and just finished the media kit for $KENDU as well. 

I’m super bullish on $KENDU 👀",8,2025-07-24 12:04:23,0,1582,positive,positive,neutral,no,453,2025-07-24 12:00:00,btc,118712.0,2361872522101.0,54325242341.0,19896712.0,122838.0,2025-07-14T07:56:01.937Z,118388.0,2354990819866.0,51803254772.0,19896946.0,122838.0,2025-07-14T07:56:01.937Z,244.14,-0.27
The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

u/StaySeaArt, who’s still a mod at r/SHIBArmy, played a big role in SHIB’s early growth with her street art, daily graphics, and the original SHIB media kit, all fueled by her passion for the community.

She’s now bringing that same creative energy to KenduSTREET, hosting real-world events like the last event: Florida Groves Fest with live muralists, free Kendu merch and drinks, and an evolving Community Tag Wall. It’s awesome to see real culture growing around crypto. She has done numerous mural arts for Kendu and just finished the media kit for $KENDU as well.

u/StaySeaArt, who’s still a mod at r/SHIBArmy, played a big role in SHIB’s early growth with her street art, daily graphics, and the original SHIB media kit, all fueled by her passion for the community.

She’s now bringing that same creative energy to KenduSTREET, hosting real-world events like the last event: Florida Groves Fest with live muralists, free Kendu merch and drinks, and an evolving Community Tag Wall. It’s awesome to see real culture growing around crypto. She has done numerous mural arts for Kendu and just finished the media kit for $KENDU as well.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

u/StaySeaArt, who’s still a mod at r/SHIBArmy, played a big role in SHIB’s early growth with her street art, daily graphics, and the original SHIB media kit, all fueled by her passion for the community.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

The culture of KENDU is unmatched.,1m81g6l,altcoin,soFinished,51,17,2025-07-24 11:06:43,"What up r/altcoin, kinda felt like writing something so I'm making this post up as I go along so let's get into it. 

  
Something that every coin that has exploded in price, popularity and culture has in common is something that really stands out or is unique. Some examples of this is the decentralisation OG Shiba Inu pushed, the first memecoin Doge, Pepe bringing 4chan memes on-chain and Flokis on-chain marketing campaigns. 

All these were 'world-firsts' and really made them stand out from the thousands of other competing coins. Let me introduce you to KENDU. This is a coin that's trying a completely new method to the memecoin game. The insane energy and desire to succeed by everyone in the community is unmatched anywhere with so many different people from different walks of life and skills is great to see, and I and many others learn something new everyday!

Not only do we have this unmatched community, we have other 'world-firsts' that will likely never be seen again which have been derived from the nature of KENDU which will basically be impossible to remake. We have an irl presence which is UNSEEN anywhere before. We have people in the community running their own initiatives out of their own pockets. Mind you these are not people who are apart of any 'team', just regular community members that decided to take it upon themselves to further the movement of KENDU. (note: there is no real 'team' in KENDU, it's a CTO where yes there are leads but anyone is free to do anything they like under the name of KENDU.)

The culture we have cultivated here is unmatched, and what’s coming next? Most people couldn't even imagine it.

I remember when the community was still building from the ground, scattered across the internet, no roadmap, just a shared mindset and the feeling that we were building something bigger than ourselves.

Now? It’s wild. The energy, the pace, the way people show up, every corner of this space is built on the KENDU culture.

You won’t find egos heres.

You won’t find mess here.

Every thread, every post, every DM is intentional. It’s sharp. It’s clean. People really *care* and have true passion here. You feel it instantly.

But what gets me the most is the people.

Everyone here would go to war for each other. No one’s just “watching”. Everyone’s contributing, creating, pushing. For the mission. For the movement.

That’s real culture.

That’s what was built, through many obstacles, not overnight, but year after year after year. Pretty much being quiet efforts with loud asf results. 

Millions of people on the outside will see the coming wins, the numbers, the recognition, the hype.

But they miss the best part:  
The essence of our culture being built brick by brick.

That’s the real flex.

u/StaySeaArt, who’s still a mod at r/SHIBArmy, played a big role in SHIB’s early growth with her street art, daily graphics, and the original SHIB media kit, all fueled by her passion for the community.

She’s now bringing that same creative energy to KenduSTREET, hosting real-world events like the last event: Florida Groves Fest with live muralists, free Kendu merch and drinks, and an evolving Community Tag Wall. It’s awesome to see real culture growing around crypto. She has done numerous mural arts for Kendu and just finished the media kit for $KENDU as well. 

I’m super bullish on $KENDU 👀",8,2025-07-24 12:04:23,0,1582,positive,positive,neutral,no,453,2025-07-24 12:00:00,shib,1.372e-05,8087815440.0,580141887.0,589501629921665.6,8.616e-05,2021-10-28T03:54:55.568Z,1.358e-05,8004410047.0,360002878.0,589501629852245.6,8.616e-05,2021-10-28T03:54:55.568Z,32768.16,-1.02
