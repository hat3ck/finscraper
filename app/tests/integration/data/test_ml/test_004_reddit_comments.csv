9678,"1m81g6l","t3_1m81g6l","Potlimitcrypto","It's been fascinating to watch Kendu grow, I'm fairly convinced that it's one of the only truly organic projects in the space at the moment, and even then our output often exceeds multibillion-dollar projects. 

The culture makes it inevitable. People are just building and doing (or duing), networking, growing businesses, etc. all in the name of Kendu in every direction all of the time.

We will eventually clear the crypto jungle and have a dominant presence in multiple sectors IRL. 

To the top, friends.",17,1753357640,0,"n4vtbxm"

9686,"1m81g6l","t3_1m81g6l","Expert-Detective-525","This is such a good post, we have an insane number of IRL initiatives including beer, shoes, energy drinks, coffee, plushies, merch, Pickleball tournaments, murals, hotdog stands, discs and many more. However, this doesn't mean we slack on social media, we are also a top performer on there with Certik rating our community 93/100, which is the highest I have ever seen. Furthermore, due to crypto hosting quite a few bad actors, the average person doesn't think too highly of the space, but this is where IRL efforts come in. IRL efforts show that a project has foundations and isn't going anywhere, it is here to stay. Kendu will be adored by retail and we will see this affect",14,1753356673,0,"n4vqzb5"

That just happened and I went out on a bike to explore and put up stickers. Kendu is a very large part of my life and something I really believe in.

I don't know when we will see all the hard work out us into the billions, but I believe it will happen.",1,1753361942,1,"n4w57cc"
9690,"1m81g6l","t3_1m81g6l","Lalph-Rauren","I found Kendu about 6 months ago, really got interested in it when I saw all the IRL presence of the community and all the work from StaySea in $KENDU, who is a Shib OG from the early days.

u/StaySeaArt, who’s still a mod at r/SHIBArmy, played a big role in SHIB’s early growth with her street art, daily graphics, and the original SHIB media kit, all fueled by her passion for the community.

She’s now bringing that same creative energy to KenduSTREET, hosting real-world events like the last event: Florida Groves Fest with live muralists, free Kendu merch and drinks, and an evolving Community Tag Wall. It’s awesome to see real culture growing around crypto. She has done numerous mural arts for Kendu and just finished the media kit for $KENDU as well. 

I’m super bullish on $KENDU 👀",8,1753358663,0,"n4vvy3g"
