Is that still a thing? Genuinely asking because I haven’t heard anyone say it since 2022 honestly.

Right now every private company and country holding BTC in their treasury or as part of a financial product like an ETF, accounts for about 9% of Bitcoin’s entire supply. And that’s just Bitcoin alone. I think we’re way past the point of ‘crypto is dead’ even being a logical argument.",8,2025-07-10 15:02:18,0,n2difqq

Had I listened to his take, I would have missed out on a life changing run. Someday I’ll get it framed on the wall.

His text: “Bro crypto is done for. You got in too late. The bankers won’t allow crypto to gain any traction because it undermines them and the rest of the world powers. You have lost your damn mind. The most powerful person or operation is the person who controls the most valuable resource and that is money.”

It’s no surprise to anyone, but he stopped communicating with me after that run, and not even a congratulations despite never throwing it in his face.",5,2025-07-10 15:15:37,0,n2dlb2g
